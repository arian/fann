# FANN: Vector search in ~300 lines of Go

Implemented a Go version of [FANN](https://github.com/fennel-ai/fann), for
Approx Nearest Neighbor search.

> FANN stands for "Fennel Approx Nearest Neighbor" and is a tiny (~200 LOC) Rust
> library for doing approx nearest neighbor search. It is meant to be for
> educational purposes. You're free to use it in production at your risk (though
> since this is only ~200 lines of Rust, you can literally read/inspect the code
> before using it in prod).
